## Description (Keynote)

This Cookbook was created with the main purpose of helping people understand local privilege escalation techniques on Windows environments. Moreover, it can be used for both attacking and defensive purposes.

:information_source: This Cookbook focuses only on misconfiguration vulnerabilities on Windows workstations/servers/machines.

:warning: Evasion techniques to bypass security protections, endpoints, and antivirus are not included in this cookbook. I created this PowerShell script, [TurnOffAV.ps1](/Lab-Setup-Scripts/TurnOffAV.ps1), which permanently disables Windows Defender. Run this with local Administrator privileges.

The main structure of this Cookbook includes the following sections for any vulnerability:

- Description
- Lab Setup
- Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Mitigation
- (Useful) References

I hope to find this CookBook useful and learn new stuff ðŸ˜‰.

## Definition

Local Privilege Escalation, also known as LPE, refers to the process of elevating user privileges on a computing system or network beyond what is intended, granting unauthorized access to resources or capabilities typically restricted to higher privilege levels. This process occurs when attackers exploit weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations within the operating system, applications, or device drivers. By exploiting these flaws, attackers can bypass security controls and escalate their privileges, potentially gaining control over the system and accessing sensitive data.

## Useful Tools

In the following table, some popular and useful tools for Windows local privilege escalation are presented:
