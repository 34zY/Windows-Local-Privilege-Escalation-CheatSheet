## Description

PowerShell history records previously run commands, including any sensitive data such as passwords. Unauthorized access to this history could lead to credential leaks, and might to privilege escalation.

## Lab Setup

:warning: <b>If you are using Windows 10 to proceed with this scenario, the local Administrator account needs to be enabled. I have created a PowerShell script named [EnableLocalAdmin.ps1](/Lab-Setup-Scripts/EnableLocalAdmin.ps1), designed to enable the local Administrator account and set a password. Please run this script with elevated privileges.</b>

Open a Powershell with local Administrator privileges and run the following command to change the passowrd of local Administrator:

```
net user Administrator Passw0rd!
```

## Enumeration

To observe the leaked credentials, you should read the `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt` PowerShell history file (It is recommended to open the TXT file from File Explorer):

```
C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

Outcome:

## Exploitation

Use these credentials to connect to a remote service or application. In this scenario, you can use these credentials to connect as local Administrator via RDP to the victim's machine.

## Mitigation

To clear the PowerShell history file, you can delete the content of the file directly:

1) Open PowerShell.

2) Run the following command: 

```
Clear-Content -Path "C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt"
```
